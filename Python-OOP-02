Using a text editor, create a Python script named tryme3.py . Write a function in this file called nine_lines that uses three_lines to print nine blank lines. Now add a function named clear_screen that prints out twenty-five blank lines. The last line of your program should be a call to clear_screen.

Answer: 
def new_line():
 print

def three_lines():
 new_line()
 new_line()
 new_line()

def nine_lines():
 three_lines()
 three_lines()
 three_lines()

def clear_screen():
 nine_lines()
 nine_lines()
 three_lines()
 three_lines()
 new_line()

clear_screen()

Move the last line of tryme3.py to the top of the program, so the function call to clear_screen appears before the function definition. Run the program and record what error message you get. Can you state a rule about function definitions and function calls which describes where they can appear relative to each other in a program?

Answer:
It is impossible to call a function before it is defined in the program. So the program will not recognize the syntax in the code.
"There's an error in your program. Invalid Syntax."

3. Starting with a working version of tryme3.py , move the definition of new_line after the definition of three_lines. Record what happens when you run this program. Now move the definition of new_line below a call to three_lines(). Explain how this is an example of the rule you stated in the previous exercise.

Answer:
After 'new_line' is moved after the definition of 'three_lines' and program is run, this message appears:
"There's an error in your program. Invalid Syntax."

After the definition of 'new_line' is moved below a call to 'three_lines' and program is run, this message appears:
"There's an error in your program: unindent does not match any outer indentation level."

4. Fill in the body of the function definition for cat_n_times so that it will print the string, s, n times:
def cat_n_times(s, n):
    <fill in your code here>
Save this function in a script named import_test.py. Now at a unix prompt, make sure you are in the same directory where the import_test.py is located ( ls should show import_test.py). Start a Python shell and try the following:
>>> from import_test import *
>>> cat_n_times('Spam', 7)
SpamSpamSpamSpamSpamSpamSpam
If all is well, your session should work the same as this one. Experiment with other calls to cat_n_times until you feel comfortable with how it works.

Answer:
def cat_n_times(a,b):
    print a * b
>>> 
harneyharneyharney
>>> 



Using the IDLE development environment, create a Python script named tryme3.py . Write a function in this file called nine_lines that uses a function called three_lines to print nine blank lines. Now add a function named clear_screen that prints out twenty-five blank lines. The last line of your program should call the function to clear_screen .
The  function three_lines and new_line are defined below so that you can see a nested function call.
def new_line():
print()
def three_lines():
new_line()
new_line()
new_line()
Submit your Python script file in the posting of your assignment. Your Python script should be either a .txt file or a .py file. You must execute your script and copy and paste the output produced into a document that you will submit along with your python script. It is very helpful if you print a placeholder between the printing of 9 lines and the printing of 25 lines. It will make your output easier to read for the assessor. A placeholder can be a comment such as “now printing 9 lines” or “now printing 25 lines”.
ANSWER:
def new_line():
print()
def three_lines():
new_line()
new_line()
new_line()
def nine_lines():
three_lines()
three_lines()
three_lines()
print(“First Line.”)
print(“now running nine blank lines…”)
nine_lines()
print(“Second Line.”)
def clear_section():
nine_lines()
nine_lines()
three_lines()
three_lines()
new_line()
print(“Line 1”)
print(“now printing 25 black lines…”)
clear_section()
print(“Line 26”)

 What will the output of this program be when it is executed?
def test_function( length, width, height):
print (“the area of the box is ”, length*width*height)
return length*width*height
l = 12.5
w = 5
h = 2
test_function(l, w, h)
print (“The area of the box is ”, length*width*height) 
A NameError because a variable not defined
What will the output of the following code be?
def recursive( depth ):
depth+=1
while (depth < 5):
ret = recursive(depth)
return depth
ret = recursive( 0 )
print (“the recursive depth is ”, ret)
None
What does the import statement in the following script do?
import StringIO
output = StringIO.StringIO()
output.write(‘First line.\n’)
output.close()
It includes a Python module called StringIO into the script

The following Python script will generate an error when executed.  What is the cause of the error?
def function2(param):
print (param, param)
print (cat)
def function1(part1, part2):
cat = part1 + part2
function2(cat)
chant1 = “See You ”
chant2 = “See Me ”
function1(chant1, chant2)

What does function subroutine do?
def subroutine( n ):
while n > 0:
print (n,)
n -= 1
Counts from n down to 1 and displays each number
The following code is an example of what principle?
bruce = 5
print (bruce,)
bruce = 7
print (bruce)

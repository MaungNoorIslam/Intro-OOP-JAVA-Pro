>>> print 'Hello, World!'
File "<input>", line 1
    print 'Hello, World!'
                        ^
SyntaxError: Missing parentheses in call to 'print'. Did you mean print('Hello, World!')?
In this example we are calling on the print function in python. In this case to “print” the words hello world, But we get a syntax error.  Meaning the python cannot interpret our input. We will need to add parentheses to indicate that we are calling on the print function.
>>>print('hello world!')
hello world!
In python 2 we do not need to use the parentheses to print. Meaning that print is not a function in python 2, whereas in python 3 we do need to use the parentheses. Indicating that in python 3 print is a function.
 
>>> 1/2
0.5
In this example we have used python like a calculator by performing simple division.
 
>>> type(1/2)
<class 'float'>
Numbers are grouped into “types” or classes for example we get. Integers and floats. In this case we have asked python what type 1/2 is, python responds with “float” indicating to us that this a decimal number.
 
 
>>> print(01)
File "<input>", line 1
    print(01)
           ^
SyntaxError: invalid token
When putting a 0 in front of a number in python we are saying that the number after the 0 should be interpreted as an octal digit. We should instead write 0o1 python will now be able to interpret this as an octal number
print(0o1)
1
 
>>> 1/(2/3)
1.5
Once again we are using python to solve a simple math. Giving us the correct answer of 1.5
